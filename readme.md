# Welcome to the Porquin wiki!
this project is meant to be a safe file vault! 
gib ideas so I can improve it! =)

## Language
This project is written in python.. just because I wanted to study python.
Maybe there is a chance to rewrite it in any other lang.
python 3.8+

## Running
Run with 

python porquinRun.py 

## Basic Usage
This is a very simple idea.
1. First you can register as many users as you can. So, create your first account and add a very safe password.
2. Login.
3. You will be redirected to the app main page and there you can add your files.
4. Add as many files as you want

## Perspective
* Currently there is no way to delete a file  in the project... to do so you must access the porquin_file which the default path is in the config.conf file using SQL.  but don't worry..its in progress.
