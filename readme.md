# Welcome to the Porquin wiki!
This project is meant to be a safe file vault! 
gib ideas so I can improve it! =)

## Language
It's written in python. Just because I wanted to study python.
Maybe there is a chance to rewrite it in any other lang.
Python 3.8+

## Running
Run with 

python porquinRun.py 

## Basic Usage
The idea is simple and objective.
1. You can register as many users as you can. So, create your first account and add a very safe password.
2. Login.
3. You will be redirected to the main page. There you can add your files.
4. Add as many files as you want

## Perspective
* By this time, there is no way to delete a file in the project. 
To do so, you must access the porquin_file using SQL. The default path is in the "config.conf" file.
* Soon, I'll make available some MSI/DEB so anyone can use it without the boring part of compiling projects
